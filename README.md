## Hi there, the name is Mercy ðŸ‘‹

With a desire to combine health sciences, technology and ethics, I am working towards finding my niche. I am interested in analyzing multimodal healthcare datasets, building ML/AI and statistical models for clinical and biomedical research. Alongside this, I am also passionate about community building through organizing conferences & interdisciplinary collaborations, and contributing to the development of ethical healthcare AI policies & strategies.

I am always learning, and advices & suggestions are highly welcomed. :)
