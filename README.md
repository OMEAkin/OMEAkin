## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mercy, with desire to combine health sciences, tech and ethics, I am working towards finding my niche. However, my interests are in analyzing multimodal healthcare datasets, building AI & statistical models, and eventually be involved in community building (e.g. conferences) and policy development.

I am always learning, and am always welcome to advices and suggestions. :)
