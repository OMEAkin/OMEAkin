## Hi there, my name is Mercy 👋

With a desire to combine health sciences, technology and ethics, I am working towards finding my niche. I am interested in analyzing multimodal/multiomic healthcare datasets, and building ML/AI & statistical models for clinical and biomedical research. Alongside this, I am also passionate about community building (e.g. through organizing conferences & interdisciplinary collaborations), and contributing to the development of ethical healthcare AI policies & strategies.

I love to learn, and advices, suggestions and collaborations are (always and) highly welcomed. :)
